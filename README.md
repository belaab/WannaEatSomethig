# WannaEatSomething
The main objective is to do a very simple, not intrusive, user friendly app.
I want to use Foursquare RESTful API.

Short info:

- you are hungry,  and You don’t want to cook,  eating alone also is not up to You
- so, you run the app, chose what you want to eat, and where
- your friends get notifications about your propositions
- somebody accepts your proposition, 
- win-win, alone eating problem solved :)

How it works?

*Observing my friends, and general, young people - very common situation* 
- You are somewhere in the city, and You feel hungry (yup, we don’t want to cook! Why losing time for cooking? Nope! )
-  of course, You want to eat something na mieście, but You don’t actually write to every of your friend with asking about eating something together - don’t know where somebody is, busy or already has eaten something. 

- instead of it, you just run simple, but very friendly app, chose  what You want to eat, maybe where? oh, You don’t don’t what to eat? don’t worry, just check option without specified meal, lets decide about it with friend
- your friends get notifications „Hey! [your name] seems to be hungry, Wanna eat something?”
- your friend clicks „Yup, let’s eat something!” Now you can message each other, choose what to eat, etc.
- win-win, alone eating problem solved :)
